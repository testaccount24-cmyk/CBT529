Matthew,

I just tried to compile SMFLST06 out of file 529 of the CBT tape
that you contributed, but it calls a program G207DCAN that is not
included.  Most of the members of this CBT entry seem to use this
program, where can I find a copy?

Cheers
Dave

This program is found in CBT tape file 527.  There are some other
useful programs in that file also.
