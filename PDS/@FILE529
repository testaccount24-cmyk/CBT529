//***FILE 529 is from Matthew Stitt, and contains some programs     *   FILE 529
//*           to report CICS statistics, and some other programs.   *   FILE 529
//*           Most of these programs are written in COBOL, but      *   FILE 529
//*           they are very useful, for people who need this        *   FILE 529
//*           information.                                          *   FILE 529

//*           There is also a program, CATLIST, to report on        *   FILE 529
//*           the contents of old-style VSAM catalogs, without      *   FILE 529
